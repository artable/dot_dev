                    <h4 class="header">What is Git Gud?</h4>
                    <p class="content">Aside from acrid gamer slang, Git Gud is the series of professional development seminars I have been hosting on my Campus for about a year now. I find students with something to share, often a project, then coach them through using that project to teach fundamental programming principles or communicate new ideas to our attendies. Usually around 30 people show up and most leave satisfied.</p>

                    <h4 class="header">Why Do You Do This?</h4>
                    <p class="content">A lot of reasons! I think there is quite a bit of power in peers teaching peers. The teacher and learner are by necessity a team, and I love watching that dynamic. I am delighted to give passionate people a chance to show off stuff they are proud of. I love learning new things, and putting one of these on is a cheat way to get a one-on-one explaination from someone proficient as we work through the presentation content. Perhaps most of all, I want programming to be approachable for people. I have found fullfillment in coding, and I would hate for someone like me to miss out on that because they gave up before they found something they clicked with.</p>

                    <h4 class="header">How Do You Do This?</h4>
                    <p class="content">It is, to be sure, a bit of a process. I've found that every mid-upper division class has at least two people in it who are itching to show something off, so that is where I source my seminars; from those students. I've also learned quite a bit about education from my Spouse, who majored in that subject. I use those ideas as a framework to teach my new-found presenter how best to show their stuff off and how to use it to teach others. They and I will do a full run-through at least once before the event. I've glossed over some of the less interesting portions of this; how we advertise and select venues, for example. The hard part, and the best part, is getting the content right.</p>
