      <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>
        What I love about programming:
        I'm a bit of a nerd about functional programming. I think one of the most fascinating problems about any coding situation is the challenge of [writing good code while communicating to humans what the code does](my approach URL) and find that problem endlessly delightful to solve. I am simply beside myself whenever I get to learn a new technique or something I have been doing for a while clicks. Good code is exciting and even sometimes beautiful to me intrinsically, let alone the incredible things you can build with it. [I am also deeply passionate about programming education](GitGud URL)
        Okay, yes, I am a total nerd, what else is there to know me:
        I have a 2.5 YO child and one more coming very soon, which keeps me super busy! My favoirte device is my e-reader, through which I enjoy books of all kinds and a generous smattering of manga. My spouse and I have recently been watching reality TV together, though previously we've had anime phases, early 2000s drama phases, indie gaming phases, and too exhausted to do anything phases (thank you newborn). We also enjoy cooking together and spending time at the park.

      <h3>My Aproach</h3>
      <p>
        Coding is Communication:
        One of my fundamental programming philosophies is that progrmaming is two different types of communication. You are communicating with a compiler, which have strict syntactical rules and rigid definitions. On this end of of the stick also live optimisation techniques and well established coding practices (e.g. building rusable containers). At the exact same time, you are communicating with the programmers who come after you (sometimes yourself!).
        These are two fundamentally different tasks, each difficult and vital to the art of good code. I constantly think about these two tasks while I code and peruse documentation, often pausing to ask myself if I am performing both to an acceptable level or if there are better tools available to me I am not using.
        
        Coding is Fun:
        Programming, if you explain it in words, does not sound fun. "Yes, today I spent several hours writing then debugging about 200 lines of code. Every time I solved one bug a new one appeared. When I finally finished the only indication that my code worked was a few white-against-black lines in the terminal I've been wrestling with."
        But for me, that process can be fun if taken with the right attitude. I often joke "if your brain is broken Juuuussst right such that you can get reward chemicals from a new error message, you should learn to be a programmer." You have to take the small victories and recognize that they will add up to an impressive finished project someday.

      <h3>Git Gud</h3>
      <p>
        What is Git Gud?
        Aside from acrid gamer slang, Git Gud is the series of professional development seminars I have been hosting on my Campus for about a year now. I find students with something to share, often a project, then coach them through using that project to teach fundamental programming principles or communicate new ideas to our attendies. Usually around 30 people show up and most leave satisfied.
        
        Why do you do this?
        A lot of reasons! I think there is quite a bit of power in peers teaching peers. The teacher and learner are by necessity a team, and I love watching that dynamic. I am delighted to give passionate people a chance to show off stuff they are proud of. I love learning new things, and putting one of these on is a cheat way to get a one-on-one explaination from someone proficient as we work through the presentation content. Perhaps most of all, I want programming to be approachable for people. I have found fullfillment in coding, and I would hate for someone like me to miss out on that because they gave up before they found something they clicked with.
        
        How do you do this?
        It is, to be sure, a bit of a process. I've found that every mid-upper division class has at least two people in it who are itching to show something off, so that is where I source my seminars; from those students. I've also learned quite a bit about education from my Spouse, who majored in that subject. I use those ideas as a framework to teach my new-found presenter how best to show their stuff off and how to use it to teach others. They and I will do a full run-through at least once before the event. I've glossed over some of the less interesting portions of this; how we advertise and select venues, for example. The hard part, and the best part, is getting the content right.
